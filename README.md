# Dice-Man
A dice rolling palette for the Newton (written in NewtonScript) designed to be used with roll playing games

From the original README that I wrote back in 1997:

DiceMan 0.5.0b

Contents: This ReadMe file, DiceMan.txt (the source code) and DiceMan.pkg (the Newton OS 2.x package).

What is it: A dice rolling palette designed to be used with roll playing games like AD&D (R).

How does it work: The controls follow AD&D conventions, X d Y +/- Z, where X is the number of dice to be rolled, Y is the type of dice (2 sided to 100 sided) and Z is the roll modifier (plus or minus 0 to 20). Hitting the "roll" button gives a total based on a random simulated dice roll.

What's next: I'd like to add a "paste" button that would copy the results at the text insertion point. I also plan to support rotating views.

Notes: This is BETA software, I'm not yet sure it is totaly safe. It has been compiled for 2.x Newton OS systems only. If you spread this around, please at least offer to include the source code and this ReadMe file. Have a nice day.
